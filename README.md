This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a simple web application that displays a collection of products and allows users to filter, sort, and view them. The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it showcases various concepts in web development such as state management, filtering, sorting, and responsive design.

Technologies Used
React: The project is primarily developed using React. React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a component-based architecture and efficient rendering.

JavaScript: The core logic of the application is implemented using JavaScript, including handling events, filtering, sorting, and dynamic content rendering.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to style the application, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

HTML: The structure of the application is built using HTML, defining the layout and components of the user interface.

Features
Product Display: The application displays a collection of products, including their name, description, price, discounted price, ratings, and an option to add them to the cart.

Filtering: Users can filter products by category using a dropdown filter. The displayed products automatically update based on the selected category.

Sorting: Products can be sorted by various options such as alphabetical order (both ascending and descending) and price (both ascending and descending).

Load More: Users can load more products from the selected category, ensuring smooth navigation through the product list.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and usability on various devices including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using npm install.
Run the development server using npm start.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

Future Enhancements

Pagination: Implement pagination to display a limited number of products per page.

Shopping Cart: Implement a shopping cart feature to allow users to add products and proceed to checkout.

User Authentication: Add user authentication to enable personalized experiences and saved preferences.

Product Details: Create a detailed product view to provide more information about each product.


 Challenges
 I had some difficulty with structuring the css for ProducTuile and the content inside that can be seen in the project. Also, app.js is full functionality that needs to be moved into the specific components.
